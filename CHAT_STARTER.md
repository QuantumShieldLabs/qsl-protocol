Goals: G4

Project directive (must follow):
- Continuous improvement: implement safe/in-scope improvements immediately; ask approval if unsure.
- ALL Codex directives must be fully contained in a single code block (or split into multiple code-block directives).
- See docs/dev/DOC-DEV-003_Assistant_Operating_Rules_v1.0.0_DRAFT.md.


# DEPRECATED — Superseded by NEXT_ACTIONS.md (New Chat Starter)

This file is retained only for backwards compatibility with older chat workflows.

**Do not paste this file into new chats.**

Where to look now:
- The authoritative “New Chat Starter” block lives at the top of **NEXT_ACTIONS.md**.
- **START_HERE.md** is the operational constitution and the first mandatory read.
- **GOALS.md / AGENTS.md / PROJECT_CHARTER.md / DECISIONS.md / TRACEABILITY.md** are the authoritative governance spine.

If any tool, script, or prior note instructs you to use this file as the chat starter, treat that instruction as stale.
