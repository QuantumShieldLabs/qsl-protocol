# QSL PROJECT PLAN + CHECKLISTS (AUTHORITATIVE)

## Ordering and navigation
The authoritative ordering for public-release work is defined in
`docs/public/PUBLIC_RELEASE_RUNBOOK.md`. Use it as the single source of
truth for step sequencing and transitions.

## Scope
This plan defines the public-release workstream only. It does not authorize
protocol or implementation changes.
