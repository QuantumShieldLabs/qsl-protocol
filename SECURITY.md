# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
Do **not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Preferred reporting method:
- Use GitHub’s private vulnerability reporting / Security Advisories for this repository.

If private reporting is not available:
- Open a minimal public issue **without exploit details** and state that you can provide additional information privately to maintainers.

## What to include
- A clear description of the issue and affected components
- Reproduction steps (if safe to share)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Impact assessment (confidentiality/integrity/availability)

## Response expectations
This is a research-grade project. We will acknowledge reports when possible and prioritize issues based on severity and impact.
