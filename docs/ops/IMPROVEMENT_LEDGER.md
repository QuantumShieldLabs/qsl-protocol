# DOC-OPS-007 — Improvement & Findings Ledger

Purpose: this is the single, committed, cross-lane backlog of engineering
findings and workflow/process recommendations. Because every lane runs as a
fresh assistant in a different qwork workspace path, per-session assistant
memory does NOT carry across lanes — **the committed repo is the only reliable
continuity channel**, so durable findings and recommendations live here.

This ledger is subordinate to the governance spine and does not reorder or
override `NEXT_ACTIONS.md`. It informs successor selection (see the Director
triage discipline in `docs/ops/DIRECTOR_OPERATIONS.md`); it does not authorize
work by itself. Entries are class-only: never record secrets, endpoints, ports,
tokens, capabilities, keys, plaintext, or ciphertext bodies here.

## How every lane uses this ledger (binding)

- READ this ledger during the Director phase of every lane (it is in the
  read-first lists of `CLAUDE.md`, `START_HERE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`).
- FILE or UPDATE an entry before closeout whenever a lane discovers an
  engineering finding or a workflow/process issue, or advances/resolves one.
- Update `status`, `originating/last lane`, and `last-updated` on any change.
- Promotion of a stable recurring lesson into canon still follows
  `docs/ops/DOC-OPS-004`. This ledger is the staging list; canon is the durable
  home once a rule is load-bearing.

## Status lifecycle

`open` → `queued` (accepted for a future lane) → `in-lane` (an active NA item is
addressing it) → `promoted` (turned into canon/decision) or `done` (resolved with
evidence) — or `wontfix` (closed with a recorded reason). Never delete entries;
close them.

## Entry ID convention

`ENG-####` for engineering findings, `WF-####` for workflow/process items;
monotonic per prefix, never reused.

## Engineering-finding schema (per DOC-AUD-001 §6)

Severity (`P0`/`P1`/`P2`/`P3`); Title; Exact surfaces (file/function/test/spec);
Claim violated; Why it matters (exploit or correctness-failure path); Minimal fix
direction (not a full design); Proof gap (missing regression/vector/property/fuzz);
Recommended directive shape (implementation-only / docs-evidence-only /
audit follow-on). Reject anti-patterns: "needs refactor", "crypto should be
reviewed", "tests insufficient" without naming the exact missing proof, or broad
severity with no failure path.

## Workflow-item schema

Title; Problem; Recommended change; Status; Originating/last lane; Last-updated.

## Engineering findings

### ENG-0001 — qsc identity/handshake verification-fingerprint semantics unclear
- Severity: P3 (robustness/UX footgun; not an identity-binding defect)
- Status: resolved-into-finding — audited by NA-0609B (D-1213); last-updated 2026-07-06
- Resolution (NA-0609B): the verification-fingerprint model is COHERENT — the
  primary pin is checked against the KEM identity fingerprint that `identity show`
  displays, with the ML-DSA signing-key fingerprint as a separate optional pin;
  there is no KEM-vs-SIG binding flaw. The residual is a P3 footgun: an
  inconsistent `--as <label>` self-label silently operates a divergent
  lazily-created identity instead of failing loud. Minimal fix: fail loud on an
  unknown self label, and/or document the single-self-label convention. See the
  NA-0609B evidence doc.
- Exact surfaces: `qsl/qsl-client/qsc/src/identity/mod.rs`,
  `qsl/qsl-client/qsc/src/handshake/mod.rs` (identity-show fingerprint vs the
  handshake peer-verify path; `--as <label>` self-identity selection)
- Claim potentially at stake: G3-adjacent operator-verifiable identity binding
- Why it matters: while driving the NA-0608 harness, the fingerprint an operator
  would compare out of band vs. the fingerprint the handshake authenticates, and
  the effect of inconsistent `--as <label>` values (which selected divergent
  lazily-created identities and produced `peer_mismatch`), were error-prone and
  ambiguous. Recorded as audit-needed, NOT a confirmed defect.
- Minimal fix direction: clarify/document the single canonical verification
  fingerprint and the self-label model; make inconsistent-label use fail loud
  rather than silently diverge.
- Proof gap: no test asserts which fingerprint an operator verifies, or that
  identity-show and handshake-verify fingerprints are consistent/clearly distinct.
- Recommended directive shape: read-only handshake/identity audit (DOC-AUD-001 §4.1),
  then a bounded remediation lane only if the audit substantiates a concrete root cause.

### ENG-0002 — qsc attachment upload session single-use per qsc session
- Severity: P3 (clarity/documentation)
- Status: open — originating lane NA-0608 (D-1209); last-updated 2026-07-06
- Exact surfaces: `qsl/qsl-client/qsc/src/attachments/mod.rs`; qsl-attachments
  service session-state path (`REJECT_QATTSVC_SESSION_STATE`)
- Claim potentially at stake: none security-critical; operability/predictability
- Why it matters: a second `file send` in the same qsc session returns
  `REJECT_QATTSVC_SESSION_STATE`; unclear whether this is intended (one attachment
  per session) or a client session-reuse limitation. Made multi-send harnessing
  require a fresh session per send.
- Minimal fix direction: document the intended per-session send semantics and, if
  by design, assert it with a test; if a limitation, file a bounded fix lane.
- Proof gap: no documented/tested statement of multi-send-per-session behavior.
- Recommended directive shape: docs/evidence-only clarification, or a small audit
  follow-on within the attachment hardening track (NA-0609).

### ENG-0003 — Non-constant-time keyed-MAC comparisons in the handshake accept path
- Severity: P3 (implementation-attack surface; low current exploitability)
- Status: done — remediated by NA-0609C (D-1214); last-updated 2026-07-06
- Resolution (NA-0609C): added a dependency-free constant-time 32-byte helper
  `hs_ct_eq_32` in handshake/mod.rs and used it at both MAC-comparison sites
  (:1458 B1 transcript MAC, :1665 A2 confirm MAC); timing-only, accept/reject
  semantics bit-for-bit unchanged; proven by a co-located unit test (equivalence
  to `==`) and the existing handshake suites passing. Residual: other tag/MAC
  comparison sites outside the handshake seam are not in scope and remain future
  work if a review finds them.
- Exact surfaces: `qsl/qsl-client/qsc/src/handshake/mod.rs:1458` (B1 transcript
  MAC) and `:1665` (A2 confirm MAC); no constant-time equality helper exists in the
  qsc or refimpl crypto stack.
- Claim potentially at stake: defense-in-depth constant-time MAC/tag verification
  (implementation-attack resistance; G5-adjacent hardening).
- Why it matters: array `!=` short-circuits and is not constant-time; a precise
  timing oracle could in principle aid MAC forgery. Exploitability is LOW here
  (acceptance also requires a valid ML-DSA signature; keys are fresh per handshake),
  but the pattern is systematic and constant-time comparison is standard hygiene.
- Minimal fix direction: add a constant-time fixed-length comparison helper and use
  it at both sites; audit for other tag comparisons.
- Proof gap: no test asserts constant-time comparison for handshake MAC/tag paths.
- Recommended directive shape: implementation-only; natural first item for the
  NA-0609 implementation-attack hardening batch.

### ENG-0004 — Directory fsync is a no-op; atomic-rename durability not guaranteed
- Severity: P3 (crash-durability; fail-closed-safe direction)
- Status: wontfix — FALSE POSITIVE, re-verified by NA-0609D (D-1216); last-updated 2026-07-06
- Correction (NA-0609D): NOT a defect. `fsync_dir_best_effort` has two cfg-gated
  definitions in `fs_store/mod.rs`: the `#[cfg(not(unix))]` variant (line 359) is a
  no-op, but the `#[cfg(unix)]` variant (line 362) does the real directory fsync
  `File::open(dir).and_then(|d| d.sync_all())`. On the deployment target
  (x86_64-linux) `write_atomic` performs a full durable sequence: content
  `sync_all` -> atomic `rename` -> directory fsync. G2 crash-durability is sound on
  Unix; the non-unix no-op is a documented best-effort degradation. The NA-0609B
  audit erred by grepping only the `not(unix)` stub. See WF-0005.
- Exact surfaces: `qsl/qsl-client/qsc/src/fs_store/mod.rs:359`
  (`fsync_dir_best_effort` is empty), called after the rename in `write_atomic`.
- Claim potentially at stake: G2 crash-safe state persistence.
- Why it matters: file content is written atomically (temp + `sync_all` + rename),
  so no partial/corrupt file is possible, but the directory entry from the rename
  is not fsync'd, so a power-loss crash right after a store can revert to the prior
  state. Direction is fail-closed-safe (revert → re-handshake), but it is a real
  gap against the G2 durability gate.
- Minimal fix direction: implement a real directory fsync, or document the
  durability boundary explicitly against G2 if deferred.
- Proof gap: no crash/durability test exercises loss of the directory entry.
- Recommended directive shape: implementation-only (or docs boundary statement),
  scoped to fs_store.

### ENG-0005 — Constant-time comparison sweep beyond the handshake seam
- Severity: P3 (implementation-attack; defense-in-depth)
- Status: resolved-into-findings — swept by NA-0611 (D-1221); last-updated 2026-07-07
- Resolution (NA-0611): the sweep found NO keyed-secret/MAC comparison outside the
  already-fixed handshake seam. `kmac_out` uses are key derivations (not compares);
  AEAD tag verification is in-primitive constant-time; protocol_state has no secret
  compares; integrity-hash (SHA-512) and route-token compares are verified-acceptable
  (timing not exploitable). Constant-time posture sound. One optional P3
  defense-in-depth item recorded as ENG-0008. See the NA-0611 evidence doc.
- Surfaces: qsc tag/MAC/secret comparison sites outside handshake/mod.rs (e.g.
  attachment capability/token checks, vault unlock).
- Why it matters: ENG-0003 fixed the handshake MAC comparisons; a sweep should
  enumerate and confirm/convert any remaining secret comparisons. DOC-G5-005 §3,9
  (rank 2).
- Recommended directive shape: read-only audit, then a bounded fix lane per finding.

### ENG-0006 — Error/retry normalization review
- Severity: P3 (implementation-attack; distinguishability)
- Status: resolved-into-findings — reviewed by NA-0612 (D-1222); last-updated 2026-07-07
- Resolution (NA-0612): within qsc, the reject taxonomy (recv_reject_*, REJECT_ATT_*,
  REJECT_QSC_HS_*) is LOCAL-ONLY (operator stdout/log markers; not transmitted on the
  wire on reject), the retry path (`bounded_retry`) is cause-agnostic (unit error;
  attempt-count-derived backoff), and no reason-carrying NACK is sent on the wire.
  No remotely-observable failure-cause oracle beyond the send/fetch timing/size
  metadata already documented (NA-0608 / DOC-G5-005). Residual: optional P3 ENG-0009
  (deterministic retry jitter) plus a service-side scope note (qsl-server /
  qsl-attachments error normalization is out of qsc-repo scope). See the NA-0612
  evidence doc.
- Surfaces: qsc/qsl-server/qsl-attachments reject-code, timing, and retry/backoff
  behavior.
- Why it matters: distinct internal failure causes should not be externally
  distinguishable beyond the deterministic reject taxonomy. DOC-G5-005 §7,9 (rank 3).
- Recommended directive shape: audit/docs review, then a bounded normalization fix.

### ENG-0007 — Attachment-plane metadata mitigation feasibility (size/count/timing)
- Severity: P3 (metadata; highest-value residual)
- Status: resolved-into-findings — studied by NA-0613 (D-1223); last-updated 2026-07-07
- Resolution (NA-0613): DOC-G5-006 inventories the residual channels (C1 object size,
  C2 part count, C3 part-size-class-by-plaintext, C4 upload/fetch timing) and shows
  object-size/part-count bucketing (M1) is client-side feasible against the
  service/network observer without an attachment-contract change, because the
  descriptor (true plaintext_len) is peer-only inside the encrypted envelope while the
  service sees only the opaque padded object. Recommended mitigation filed as ENG-0010;
  timing/cover deferred as ENG-0011. Honest residual documented (no metadata
  elimination). See DOC-G5-006.
- Surfaces: qsl-attachments object storage/service contract; qsc attachment path.
- Why it matters: NA-0608 showed ciphertext-object size, object/part count, and
  upload/fetch timing are EXPOSED residual metadata on the attachment plane (the
  message plane already has padding/bucketing). DOC-G5-005 §2,6,9 (rank 4). Touches
  the attachment contract; needs feasibility+design before any behavior change.
- Recommended directive shape: read-only feasibility+design (cost/benefit matrix),
  then a separate implementation lane if justified.

### ENG-0008 — Verification-code equality is not constant-time (optional defense-in-depth)
- Severity: P3 (defense-in-depth; NOT exploitable)
- Status: open — originating lane NA-0611 (D-1221); last-updated 2026-07-07
- Surfaces: `qsl/qsl-client/qsc/src/tui/controller/commands/contacts.rs:1194` and
  `qsl/qsl-client/qsc/src/contacts/mod.rs:1237` (`if expected == provided`).
- Why it matters: the trust-promotion gate compares the pinned identity fingerprint
  against the operator-provided code with `==` (not constant-time). This is NOT a
  keyed-secret comparison: the fingerprint is public (safety-number-style, derived
  from the peer's public key), and any local attacker able to build a timing oracle
  already has direct read access to it — so there is no practical timing advantage.
- Minimal fix direction: use a constant-time fixed-length comparison at these two
  sites if a future lane elects the hardening.
- Recommended directive shape: optional small implementation-only lane; low priority.

### ENG-0009 — Deterministic retry backoff jitter (optional defense-in-depth)
- Severity: P3 (defense-in-depth; NOT a failure-cause oracle)
- Status: open — originating lane NA-0612 (D-1222); last-updated 2026-07-07
- Surface: `qsl/qsl-client/qsc/src/main.rs` `bounded_retry` — the backoff jitter is
  deterministic (attempt-count-derived), not randomized.
- Why it matters: retry is cause-agnostic and retry attempts are not remotely
  observable in the current model, so this leaks no failure cause. It is recorded only
  because a deterministic backoff is more predictable than a randomized one in a
  hypothetical live send-retry-to-relay scenario; any concern there ties to the
  send-timing metadata already tracked (NA-0608 / DOC-G5-005), not to distinguishability.
- Minimal fix direction: randomize the retry jitter only if send-retry-to-relay timing
  is ever made a live mitigation target; otherwise no action.
- Recommended directive shape: optional small implementation-only lane; low priority.

### ENG-0010 — Attachment-plane object-size/part-count bucketing (recommended mitigation)
- Severity: P3 (metadata; highest-value residual — the top NA-0613 recommendation)
- Status: open — originating lane NA-0613 (D-1223); last-updated 2026-07-07
- Surface: `qsl/qsl-client/qsc/src/attachments/mod.rs` object sizing/chunking path.
- Why it matters: today `ciphertext_len = plaintext_len + part_count*tag` (no object
  padding), so the service/network observer learns the plaintext size almost exactly
  (C1), plus a coarse count (C2) and a 3-way class band (C3). DOC-G5-006 M1/M2/M3.
- Design (client-only, no contract change): pad the plaintext to a defined size ladder
  before chunk/AEAD; keep descriptor `plaintext_len` true (peer decrypt truncates);
  `ciphertext_len`/`part_count`/integrity root reflect the padded object; choose the
  part-size-class from the padded size. Keep all size fields consistent in the per-part
  AAD and confirm MAC.
- Recommended directive shape: full-ritual implementation lane (NA-0614) with
  deterministic bucketed-size vectors, fail-closed decrypt/truncation preserved, and
  explicit bandwidth/storage-overhead accounting. No metadata-free claim.

### ENG-0011 — Attachment upload/fetch timing and cover-traffic (deferred, cross-repo)
- Severity: P3 (metadata; deferred)
- Status: open — originating lane NA-0613 (D-1223); last-updated 2026-07-07
- Surface: qsl-attachments service/deployment (primary); optional qsc send/fetch jitter.
- Why it matters: upload/fetch timing and access pattern (C4) are observable by the
  service/network and are largely a qsl-attachments/deployment property, not a qsc-only
  concern; cover traffic is high-cost.
- Recommended directive shape: separate cross-repo design/implementation in
  qsl-attachments; optional small qsc-side jitter follow-up. Lower priority than ENG-0010.

## Workflow / process items

### WF-0001 — Cross-lane continuity requires an in-repo ledger
- Status: done — lane NA-0609A (D-1211); last-updated 2026-07-06
- Problem: each lane is a fresh assistant in a different qwork workspace path, so
  per-session assistant memory does not propagate; findings/recommendations were
  lost or buried in append-only journal narrative.
- Recommended change: an in-repo, committed, triageable ledger (this document)
  wired into the mandatory reads. Resolved by NA-0609A.

### WF-0002 — Reduce micro-lane ceremony without weakening rails
- Status: done — lane NA-0609A (D-1211); last-updated 2026-07-06
- Problem: the queue advanced through many high-ceremony micro-lanes; the cost is
  per-lane ritual, not lane count.
- Recommended change: define a WAVE lane class (one directive, several bounded
  sub-items, shared evidence) and a LITE-CEREMONY class (single PR/decision for
  genuinely low-risk docs/process/read-only-audit work only), with a hard
  fail-closed boundary excluding anything touching protocol/wire/crypto/auth/
  state-machine/security/dependencies/lockfiles/workflows/branch-protection/
  public-safety/runtime. Resolved by NA-0609A in `docs/ops/DIRECTOR_OPERATIONS.md`.

### WF-0003 — Director must triage the ledger and roadmap gates each turn
- Status: done — lane NA-0609A (D-1211); last-updated 2026-07-06
- Problem: no explicit obligation tied successor selection to the ledger or the
  DOC-PROG-001 release gates, risking queue drift.
- Recommended change: a Director triage discipline (in `docs/ops/DIRECTOR_OPERATIONS.md`)
  requiring each Director turn to read this ledger and the DOC-PROG-001 gates and
  justify successor selection against them. Resolved by NA-0609A.

### WF-0004 — Consecutive lanes in the same NA workspace get a stale qwork proof
- Status: open — originating lane NA-0609C (D-1214); last-updated 2026-07-06
- Problem: when a second lane reuses an existing NA workspace, re-running the
  operator startup gate (`qwork`) returns the cached proof from the earlier run
  rather than regenerating it, so the proof `head`/timestamp name a superseded
  commit while live `origin/main` has advanced. Observed twice in one session
  (before NA-0609B and before NA-0609C); each time the executor caught it fail-
  closed by verifying the proof against live state and stopped.
- Recommended change: for a new lane after any merge in the same NA workspace,
  drop the disposable checkout before re-running the startup gate
  (`drop_checkout.sh <lane> <repo>` then the startup gate), so a fresh checkout at
  current `origin/main` with a fresh proof is minted. Add a one-line note to
  `docs/ops/DIRECTOR_OPERATIONS.md` §5 (verified-state) capturing this, and/or a
  startup-gate enhancement to refresh an existing checkout's proof.
- Recommended directive shape: docs/process (a LITE lane) to add the runbook note.

### WF-0005 — Audits must check for cfg-gated alternate definitions before calling a function a no-op
- Status: done — lane NA-0609D (D-1216); last-updated 2026-07-06
- Problem: the NA-0609B audit reported ENG-0004 (a directory-fsync no-op) as a
  finding by grepping and seeing only the `#[cfg(not(unix))]` stub of
  `fsync_dir_best_effort`; it missed the `#[cfg(unix)]` variant that does the real
  fsync. The finding was a false positive (see ENG-0004 correction).
- Recommended change: when a read-only audit concludes a function is a no-op or
  stub, first grep for all definitions of that symbol (including `#[cfg(...)]`,
  `#[cfg(not(...))]`, target-gated, and feature-gated variants) and read the one
  that applies to the deployment target before recording a finding. Lesson
  recorded here for future audit lanes (DOC-AUD-001 methodology); resolved by
  NA-0609D re-verification and this note.
