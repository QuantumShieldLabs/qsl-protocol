# CodeQL baseline cleanup — hard-coded cryptographic value (Rust)

Goals: G2, G3
Status: DRAFT
Date: 2026-01-18

## Purpose
Eliminate `rust/hard-coded-cryptographic-value` findings in the Rust codebase so CodeQL is a high-signal regression gate.

## Scope
- Replace hard-coded key-like literals in helpers/tests/tooling with runtime-generated bytes.
- Keep protocol and wire semantics unchanged.
- Allow sentinel values only if guarded fail-closed before any cryptographic use.

## Invariants
- No hard-coded key-like values in Rust helper/test code paths flagged by CodeQL.
- Any sentinel remains guarded and is never used as a crypto key.
- Deterministic, fail-closed behavior is preserved.

## Validation
- Local: `cargo test -p quantumshield_refimpl --locked`
- Local CodeQL: `codeql/rust-queries:codeql-suites/rust-code-scanning.qls` returns 0 results for `rust/hard-coded-cryptographic-value`.
- CI CodeQL: PASS.

## Evidence
- SARIF summary before/after.
- PR diff limited to the CodeQL-flagged files.
