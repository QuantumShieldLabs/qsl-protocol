# NA-0017 — Signal comparative review (coverage note)

Goals: G4, G5

This file exists to satisfy the goal-lint coupling rule for core protocol document changes.
NA-0017 is a docs-only comparative review lane. The executable artifacts will be
created only after the review produces concrete, bounded NEXT_ACTIONS items.

Authoritative references:
- docs/review/DOC-REV-001_Signal_Comparative_Review_v1.0.0_DRAFT.md
- NEXT_ACTIONS.md: NA-0017

Scope notes:
- Clean-room, paraphrase-only review (no code copying).
- No protocol behavior changes in NA-0017 PR1/PR2; PR2 populates DOC-REV-001 with a decision-grade matrix and Top-5 actions.
